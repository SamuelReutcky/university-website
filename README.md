# Cedar Valley University Website

This project is a website for a fictional university, Cedar Valley University.
The site includes three main sections: the home page, which highlights the
university's programs, recent news, and events; the "About Us" page, which
provides a detailed history of the university, its mission, and its global
impact; and the "Contact Us" page, offering important contact details and links 
to resources. The website is built using HTML and CSS, focusing on clean design, 
easy navigation, and responsive layouts to ensure a user-friendly experience 
across different devices.
